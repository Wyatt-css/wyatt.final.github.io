        <h2>Our journey in the music world!*</h2>
        <h3>
        Me, John Guitar and Jane Bass, started out making music in our little garage in the south east part of the the town Morioh.
        It was quite bizzare there so we moved to Flordia and rented an apartment there once we were old enough. Luckily we were able to afford a house then we
        started renting out a studio to start producing music and started our indie band The Quad Strings.</h3> 

    <br>

    <h2>Our success.*</h2>
        <h3 class="lighter">We were a hit in our local
        area but never made it big. After a decade and a half of making music we split up and our drummer, Joe Drum got a new job and our
        singer, Johnny Microphone went solo.</h3>

    <br>

        <h2>After splitting up.*</h2>
        <h3>Jane Bass and I were sad about the band splitting but we still wanted to do something music related.
        Making music is all about expressing yourself, so we thought to make a compamy where you can express yourself even more with music
        by letting you customize your own guitar. If we can get enough sales we hope to expand to more instruments!</h3>
